# TODO

## Reimagine the app's UI

  ### Add a landing page
    -create a new header for the website (home/About/upcoming features (raspberry pi/pic/stm32)/signup/login) (visit devin.ai and other websites for refrence)
    -the landing page should be a single page with multiple sectors when the user clicks on something it takes them to that specific sector
    -the entire app should be a dark mode app
  ### Reimagine the project Studio/code preview/upload/projects/download/settings sections
    -the current home page shall become the "Studio Page" where the user can build his project and test it
    -the code preview featyre should be a button that allows the user to switch between blocks and code (might add coding feature in the future)
    -the upload and download code should be just 2 buttons, simple and clear for the user so they do not make mistakes in the future
    -the projects page ----> add user specific projects and add search and filtering features 
    -the current projects page ----> it's a projects gallery for you to use as a starting template (like figma templates...)
    -save project button and alert should be added to Studio Page
    -make a separation between public and private projects to allow the  users to publish their projects under their names to the public to ensure community support in the future.
    -tutorial pop-ups for upcoming users boxes that point at each button on the screen with conersational text to tell the user about each button and what it does.
    -add a button called "feeling stuck ? whatch this quick tutorial"
    -add begginner mode, after a user selects a component a pop-up message appears highlighting the proper way to wire that component so they don't get to dammage it (for example: a user selects a led a pop-up appears saying "when you're working with LEDs make sure to add resistance with the equivalence of [usual value for resistance used with led] and wire it like in the simulator to ensure you won't dammage it")
