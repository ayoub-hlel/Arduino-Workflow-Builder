                Arduino Workflow Builder is a user-friendly platform developed
                by Tunisian Students that simplifies the learning of electronics and
                programming. Designed for students of all levels, Arduino
                Workflow Builder enables them to explore and create
                Arduino-based projects through an intuitive, block-based
                interface.

            <p>
                Inspired by popular visual programming environments like Scratch
                and Blockly, Arduino Workflow Builder makes coding accessible to
                beginners by allowing them to drag and drop code blocks,
                eliminating the need to learn complex syntax. This approach
                empowers users to immediately see how their code interacts with
                electronic components such as LEDs, sensors, motors, and more.
                The platform also includes real-time simulations, helping
                students visualize circuit wiring alongside code execution for a
                more interactive learning experience.
